This directory contains input files for benchmarking RASTER. The data
was generated by the provided scripts, which create files without noise.
Input files with up to 10K clusters (5M points) were generated with 
generator_big.py, larger input files with generator_huge.py. The latter uses a
faster but less random approach for selecting cluster centers around which
points are spread.
